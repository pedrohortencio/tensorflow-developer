# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer

Repository containing my coursework for [Deeplearning.AI TensorFlow Developer specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) available in Coursera.

### 1 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
*Link and summary of the Jupyter Notebooks*
  * [Exercise 1](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/tensorflow-developer/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/Exercise_1_House_Prices_Question.ipynb) - simple neural network to predict a house price.
  * [Exercise 2](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/tensorflow-developer/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/Exercise2_Question.ipynb) - classification using Fashion MNIST dataset.
  * [Exercise 3](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/tensorflow-developer/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/Excercise_3_Question.ipynb) - classification using Fashion MNIST dataset, with convolutional layer.
  * [Exercise 4](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/tensorflow-developer/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/Exercise4_Question.ipynb) - classification of facial expression between sad or happy.
  * [Complex Images]() - using CNNs to create a model that differentiates between human or horse pictures. There's a visualization of the images as they pass through the neural network.
  * [Conv and Pooling 1](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/tensorflow-developer/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/Conv_and_Pooling_1.ipynb) - improving computer vision accuracy using convolutions. An explanation about CNNs.
  * [Conv and Pooling 2](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/tensorflow-developer/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/Conv_and_Pooling_2.ipynb) - part 2 of the previous notebook. It focus on the pooling layers.
  * [Lesson 2](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/tensorflow-developer/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/Lesson_2_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb) - Fashion MNIST example.
